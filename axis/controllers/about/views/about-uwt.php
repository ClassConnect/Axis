A teacher's job isn't about managing their students. If that were the case, they would be called a managers, not teachers. A teacher's job is to put content into the hands of their students and make it come to life. But with state mandated management & hundreds of students, there simply aren't enough hours in the day to reach every student.
<br /><br />
This is about to change.
<br /><br />
We've seen how remarkable the results are when you put <a href="http://www.thedailyriff.com/articles/how-the-flipped-classroom-is-radically-transforming-learning-536.php" target="_blank">high quality content into the hands of a student.</a> There is a direction correlation between the quality of content and the quality of learning. Therefore, the best content has to succeed and be used in the classroom - because if it isn't, then the students won't succeed either.

<br /><br />
Teachers from around the world are working together to create, share, and enhance the best educational content to ensure high quality learning for their students. We want you to be a part of this incredible community because the only way we will win is if we all work together.

<br /><br /> This is the turning point for education. United We Teach.
