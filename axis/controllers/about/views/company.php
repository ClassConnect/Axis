Technology has changed the way we view and interact with the world around us. The internet allows us to collaborate and communicate with one another more effectively than ever before. Businesses and consumers use these advanced technologies every day, yet only a handful of classrooms have been keeping up. To make matters worse, the ones that are trying to stay on top of technology find themselves using outdated and repurposed business software.<br /><br />

We believe that educational software should be built from the ground up to fit the unique dynamics of the classroom. Building software centered around a gradebook implies that students are nothing more than a collection of numbers associated with a letter grade. We know today, more than ever, that a classroom is not simply a place to go to be evaluated. A classroom is a place for teachers to engage, interact and share knowledge with their students. More importantly, students need to be able to continue learning outside of the classroom.<br /><br />

We know this because ClassConnect was built <strong>by</strong> students and teachers <strong>for</strong> students and teachers.<br /><br />And best of all, this is just the beginning.
