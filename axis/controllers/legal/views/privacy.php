    <p>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</p> 
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Company collects and uses information from its users who access the Website and use our services, including Company's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information").  Also, this Privacy Policy covers Company's treatment of any Personal Information that Company's business partners share with Company, or that you provide to the Company through a third party website using a Company application.  This policy does not apply to websites or practices of companies that Company does not own or control, or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage.</p> 
    <p>HOW IS CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION TREATED?</p> 
    <p>If you are a minor (under the age of 18), you may only use this service and disclose Personal Information with your parent or guardian's express consent.        Company collects limited Personal Information from students ("Children's Personal Information"), but only where that student's school, district, and/or teacher has contracted with Company to collect Children's Personal Information from students for the use and benefit of the learning environment. Company requires schools, districts, and/or teachers to obtain parental consent from students' parents before collecting any such Children's Personal Information.  If you are a student, please do not send any Children's Personal Information about yourself to us, other than what we request from you when you sign up for the Services. In the event that we learn that we have collected Children's Personal Information from a student without parental consent being obtained by his or her school, district, and/or teacher, or if we learn a student has provided us Children's Personal Information beyond what we request when he or she signs up for the Services, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student may have provided us Children's Personal Information beyond what is requested when signing up for the Services, or that a student's school, district, or teacher has not obtained parental consent, please contact us at support@classconnect.com.</p> 
    <p>Hereinafter, references to "Personal Information" shall apply to personal information of individual Website users who are not student registrants.  References to "Children's Personal Information" shall only apply to personal information of student users of the Website.  General references to "information" shall apply to all users.</p>

    <p>When you use the Website, you may set up your personal profile, send messages, perform searches and queries, and transmit information through various channels, depending on the category of user ("User Category") you are, and as permitted by the functionality of the Website. The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services, and, in some cases, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile through the Website. In most cases, we retain such information so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information. In addition to the foregoing, we collect the following types of information from our users.</p>
